      <description>This blog post explores the concept of Perfect Security in cryptography, which guarantees that observing a ciphertext provides no additional information about the original message. We establish a fundamental theorem stating that Perfect Security is equivalent to the statistical independence of ciphertexts and plaintexts. However, Shannonâ€™s Theorem proves that achieving Perfect Security requires the secret key to be at least as long as the message, making practical implementations infeasible beyond small-scale use cases like the One-Time Pad.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I explore how cybercriminals exploit chat applications like Zalo and Telegram to extract users&amp;rsquo; IP addresses through methods like URL spoofing and phishing. By creating and distributing spoofed URLs, attackers can deceive users into revealing sensitive information. I also highlight a specific vulnerability in Telegram that exposes user IP addresses during calls. Learn the mechanics of these attacks, see a detailed proof of concept, and discover essential tips to protect your privacy online.</description>
