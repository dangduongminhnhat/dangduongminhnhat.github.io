      <description>A deep-dive into advanced process injection techniques, demonstrating how to bypass Windows&amp;rsquo; Protected Process Light (PPL) security mechanism. The post covers the journey from classic DLL injection to exploiting the &lt;code&gt;KnownDlls&lt;/code&gt; TOCTOU vulnerability in CSRSS, and finally using Shellcode Reflective DLL Injection (sRDI) to achieve code execution in a PPL process.</description>

      <title>Session Hijacking: Transferring Chrome Cookies and Bypassing Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</title>
      <link>https://dangduongminhnhat.github.io/posts/d020725/session-hijacking/</link>

      <description>This blog is a detailed technical guide on how to perform session hijacking by extracting, decrypting, and transferring encrypted Google Chrome cookies from one computer to another. It delves into Chrome’s security mechanisms, explaining how cookies are encrypted using the AES-256-GCM algorithm and how the encryption key is protected by Windows&amp;rsquo; Data Protection API (DPAPI). The blog specifically highlights the complexities involved in handling the newer version 20 (v20) cookies, which are protected by App-Bound Encryption and require SYSTEM-level privileges to decrypt. By following the instructions provided, readers will be able to clone a login session and potentially bypass even two-factor authentication (2FA) mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cryptography 1: Perfect Security and the Limits of Perfect Security</title>
      <link>https://dangduongminhnhat.github.io/posts/cryptography/p1/</link>

      <description>This blog post explores the concept of Perfect Security in cryptography, which guarantees that observing a ciphertext provides no additional information about the original message. We establish a fundamental theorem stating that Perfect Security is equivalent to the statistical independence of ciphertexts and plaintexts. However, Shannon’s Theorem proves that achieving Perfect Security requires the secret key to be at least as long as the message, making practical implementations infeasible beyond small-scale use cases like the One-Time Pad.</description>

      <guid>https://dangduongminhnhat.github.io/posts/d050824/extracting-ip-address/</guid>
      <description>In this blog post, I explore how cybercriminals exploit chat applications like Zalo and Telegram to extract users&amp;rsquo; IP addresses through methods like URL spoofing and phishing. By creating and distributing spoofed URLs, attackers can deceive users into revealing sensitive information. I also highlight a specific vulnerability in Telegram that exposes user IP addresses during calls. Learn the mechanics of these attacks, see a detailed proof of concept, and discover essential tips to protect your privacy online.</description>
