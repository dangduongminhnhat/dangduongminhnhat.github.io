      <description>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptography, verifying large-degree polynomials efficiently is a challenge. The FRI protocol solves this by enabling the prover to demonstrate that a given polynomial is close to a low-degree one through a series of recursive folding steps. By halving the polynomial&amp;rsquo;s degree progressively, the FRI protocol reduces computational complexity while preserving the security of the verification process. The prover commits to the polynomial&amp;rsquo;s evaluations using Merkle trees, ensuring both integrity and consistency, which are verified through collinearity checks. In this blog, we take a deep dive into the mechanics of the FRI protocol, from the commitment phase where the degree is halved to the query phase where the verifier checks consistency. Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, cryptography expert, or just curious about the future of digital proofs, understanding the FRI protocol will give you a glimpse into the future of secure, scalable cryptographic verification.</description>
