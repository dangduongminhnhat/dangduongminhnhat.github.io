      <description>This blog provides a comprehensive overview of zk-Rollups and zkEVMs, highlighting their advantages in scalability, data compression, and enhanced privacy. Despite their potential, challenges such as developer unfriendliness and lack of composability hinder widespread adoption. By examining two primary approaches for building decentralized applications (DApps) on zk-Rollups—application-specific circuits and universal EVM circuits—we shed light on the ongoing evolution of Ethereum technology. Ultimately, the zkEVM represents a significant leap forward, merging familiar smart contract execution with the groundbreaking capabilities of zero-knowledge proofs.</description>
