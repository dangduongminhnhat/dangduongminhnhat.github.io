      <description>Polynomials Understanding Polynomials in Cryptography: A Simple Guide Polynomials are more than just mathematical expressions you encounter in schoolâ€”they are powerful tools with wide-ranging applications, especially in the field of cryptography. But what exactly are polynomials, and why are they so crucial?&#xA;What Are Polynomials? At their core, polynomials are expressions made up of variables like $x$ combined using basic operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Each piece of the expression, known as a term, includes a variable (like $x$) and often a coefficient, which is just a number multiplying the variable.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I explore how cybercriminals exploit chat applications like Zalo and Telegram to extract users&amp;rsquo; IP addresses through methods like URL spoofing and phishing. By creating and distributing spoofed URLs, attackers can deceive users into revealing sensitive information. I also highlight a specific vulnerability in Telegram that exposes user IP addresses during calls. Learn the mechanics of these attacks, see a detailed proof of concept, and discover essential tips to protect your privacy online.</description>
