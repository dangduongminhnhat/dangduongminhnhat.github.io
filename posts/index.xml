      <description>Background In today&amp;rsquo;s digital landscape, where the sophistication of cyberattacks is constantly evolving, understanding the tools and techniques that attackers use is crucial for strengthening our defenses. Among these tools are Canarytokens, Homoglyph attacks, and Right-to-Left Override (RTLO) attacks. These methods, though varied in their approach, share a common goal: to deceive and exploit unsuspecting users, leading to potentially severe consequences. In this blog, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore each of these concepts in detail, revealing how they work, why they&amp;rsquo;re effective, and how you can protect yourself and your organization from falling victim to these hidden threats.</description>

      <title>Extracting IP Addresses via Chat Apps: Zalo and Telegram</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/d050824/extracting-ip-address/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2024 12:46:40 +0700</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/posts/d050824/extracting-ip-address/</guid>
      <description>In this blog post, I explore how cybercriminals exploit chat applications like Zalo and Telegram to extract users&amp;rsquo; IP addresses through methods like URL spoofing and phishing. By creating and distributing spoofed URLs, attackers can deceive users into revealing sensitive information. I also highlight a specific vulnerability in Telegram that exposes user IP addresses during calls. Learn the mechanics of these attacks, see a detailed proof of concept, and discover essential tips to protect your privacy online.</description>
