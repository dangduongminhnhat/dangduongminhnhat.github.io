      <title>Cryptography 2: Semantic Security Prevents Message Recovery Attacks — A Security Reduction Proof</title>
      <link>https://dangduongminhnhat.github.io/posts/cryptography/p2/</link>

      <description>This blog introduces the notion of message recovery attacks, defines the corresponding security game, and proves that semantic security implies message recovery security via a black-box reduction. A semantic adversary is constructed by wrapping around a message recovery adversary, showing that any success in message recovery would contradict semantic security. This sets the stage for future reductions that interrelate various cryptographic security notions.</description>

      <title>Cryptography 1: Perfect Security and the Limits of Perfect Security</title>
      <link>https://dangduongminhnhat.github.io/posts/cryptography/p1/</link>

      <description>This blog post explores the concept of Perfect Security in cryptography, which guarantees that observing a ciphertext provides no additional information about the original message. We establish a fundamental theorem stating that Perfect Security is equivalent to the statistical independence of ciphertexts and plaintexts. However, Shannon’s Theorem proves that achieving Perfect Security requires the secret key to be at least as long as the message, making practical implementations infeasible beyond small-scale use cases like the One-Time Pad.</description>

      <description>In the rapidly evolving world of cryptography, verifying large-degree polynomials efficiently is a challenge. The FRI protocol solves this by enabling the prover to demonstrate that a given polynomial is close to a low-degree one through a series of recursive folding steps. By halving the polynomial&amp;rsquo;s degree progressively, the FRI protocol reduces computational complexity while preserving the security of the verification process. The prover commits to the polynomial&amp;rsquo;s evaluations using Merkle trees, ensuring both integrity and consistency, which are verified through collinearity checks. In this blog, we take a deep dive into the mechanics of the FRI protocol, from the commitment phase where the degree is halved to the query phase where the verifier checks consistency. Whether you are a blockchain enthusiast, cryptography expert, or just curious about the future of digital proofs, understanding the FRI protocol will give you a glimpse into the future of secure, scalable cryptographic verification.</description>
